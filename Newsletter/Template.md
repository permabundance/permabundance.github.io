## Letter #1: Welcome to Permabundance! 

Welcome to the first Permabundance newsletter! 

In the coming weeks, I will be writing small updates, how-to guides, and ethical manifestos. Overall, I hope to bring Permabundance into being: an economic enterprise where I can leverage my knowledge and hard work to build ecological, food, and social abudnace in Iowa and abroad!

With any enterprise, defining a start date is nebulous. This is especially true for vocational endeavors informed by a lifetime of passion identification and knowledge seeking. I look forward to sharing my thoughts, plans, and offerings in the near future, but today I would just like to say hello and let you know how thankful I am to have you along in the journey with me. 

May you have permanent abundance,
Dr. Reid Brown
